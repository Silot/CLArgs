## About

The Library enables the user to use it through an IDE or execute an .java, .class array in the terminal
To do this first, set a main () as in the example to locate the file through the terminal and make compile javac named.java and execute the java name that is referenced in the file name.class

-------------------------------
Through the CLArgs library (CommandLineArguments) it can find a directory that works.
It can create folders or delete them by selecting both the path itself and the file for deletion or creations for both commands.

--------------------------------

It also has the ability to handle Strings that can select what phrase they want to print as well as how they are horizontally or vertically. These functions enable the programmer to choose whether or not to have a return value.
You can also call help with options as well as get the name of the individual computer that works independently with the platform.

# CLArgs - about (find more in the repo's wiki)

A command-line argument or parameter is an item of information provided to a program when it is started. A program can have many command-line arguments that identify sources or destinations of information, or that alter the operation of the program.

When a command processor is active a program is typically invoked by typing its name followed by command-line arguments (if any). For example, in Unix and Unix-like environments, an example of a command-line argument is:

rm file.s
"file.s" is a command-line argument which tells the program rm to remove the file "file.s".
